    Welcome to the family, Reddcoin. After a long time of not being heavily involved in the doge community, I've
    gradually become more involved with Reddcoin. Although I do discourage day trading, sometimes it's nice to check the
    price without having to resort to cryptsy's relatively lacking UI. This, Reddtrader was born.
