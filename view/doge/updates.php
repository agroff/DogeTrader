    Over the weekend you may have noticed the graph was messed up a bit, showing a value of 0 Satochi from cryptsy.
    I believe this error is because cryptsy fails to respond under heavy load, and in absence of a valid response
    my sloppy code records this as a value of zero. Rather than fix my sloppy code I wrote some new code to fix
    those base entries by averaging the value before and after. The graph should be more consistent now.

    The historical graph of price in satoshi and two different measures of USD has been added. A feature to
    select the time range was also added. Only a day and a half of data is available at this point so older
    reports won't be complete.

    Today I switched the fiat conversions from using bitcoin charts to using coinbase. Coinbase is more
    expensive
    generally but at least they're reliable. I noticed bitcoin charts was pricing 1 BTC at 87 USD which is just
    ridiculous since the actual price was closer $650. I thought their weighted average would provide a good and
    stable exchange agnostic price, but I was so very wrong. I highly recommend not using their API for
    anything.

    Today I will also begin storing data for the first time in this site's history. I plan to store the price of
    doge
    in both satoshi and USD and eventually provide a graph of both prices. The recent fluctuations in BTC to
    fiat
    are making it more difficult to determine the true direction of DOGE as compared to fiat so I feel this
    feature
    is necessary.
</p>

<p>
    Some other ideas: I want to add a section with mining/halving data. I'm considering getting data from other
    exchanges, especially vault of satoshi for direct DOGE/USD data. I am also considering text to speech
    monitoring
    of the order book and change log. I also want volume in the form of BTC per 5 minutes, with alarms for high
    volumes. If any of those sound important to you let me know and there's a higher chance I'll get around to
    them. Doge tips also effect my motivation.
